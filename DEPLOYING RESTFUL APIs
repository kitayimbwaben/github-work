                                      DEPLOYING RESTFUL APIs  

  Using  Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda function to create and deploy an API.  

  1. In this, **Amazon API Gateway acts as the"front door" for applications to access data,business logic, and functionality from backend services**.  

  2. An application makes an HTTP request to access the backend.   

  3. API Gateway **handles the request and all the tasks involved in accepting and processing the API call**.  

 4.  API Gateway **invokes AWS Lambda which processes the request and returns  a response**. API Gateway receives the response and returns it to the application.   

 5. With the ability to make synchronous calls from API Gateway to Lambda, users can create fully serverless applications and serverless microservices.    

  6. Using API Gateway, users can create multiple new endpoints and point them to different Lambda functions.
