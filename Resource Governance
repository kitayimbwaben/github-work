                         ******RESOURCE GOVERNANCE******8
**Problem Statement**: 
An organization employs a number of bright young minds every year to help innovate. But sometimes, those bright young minds forget to enable versioning or encryption on their buckets. 1. ****A company requires to identify when systems are noncompliant? **** 2. The organization also wishes to monitor if the correct tag identifiers are not applied to the system? We need every resource tagged with key identifiers, such as the cost center. 

****SOLUTION **** 
For managing the configurations of your system, you can use AWS Config. You can get notified as soon as your systems are  changed  and you can set up automatic rollbacks. 
 Secondly using AWS Config, you can create custom rules based on your specific requirements . **********You can enforce  configurations, including proper  resource tagging. This helps you to quickly find noncompliant resources**.
