Building a Central monitoring dashboard that immediately and automatically notifies engineers of a system failure

This solution uses Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your aws resources in real time. 
 You can create cloudwatch alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring when a threshold you specify is crossed. 

 CloudWatch natively integrates with more than 70 AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) 
 Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon Lambda. 

 In this Solution , three ec2 instances are running All of the instances publish metrics to cloudWatch (CPU and Memory Utilization). 

 The CPU metric is natively provided by the integration between Amazon ec2 and CloudWatch. 

 Memory utilization is a custom metric meaning that the ec2 instances have local Agent that publishes metrics to cloudwatch . Custom metrics can be published to cloudWatch using the AWS CLI or an API. 

 Cloudwatch is then configured with a second alarm that watches a metric and monitors a specific threshold.  

 An alarm can perform one or more actions based on it's configuration in this solution. I use two actions sending a notification to Amazon Simple Notification Service and performing an action on ec2.

 To collect aditional system level and application metrics from both On premises and AWS  resources , including custom metrics such as memory utilization, you can install the cloudwatch Agent. 
  
The agent configuration file is a JSON file thatspecifies the metrics and logs that the agent is to collect, including custom metrics.  

I have attached the Project Workflow Diagram to illustrate the Resource Monitoring project i used Visual Paradigm to design this solution.
