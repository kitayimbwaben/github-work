                                 BACKING UP DATA (AWS) 

This project focusses on helping a company with AWS Backup to centralize and automate data protection across aws services.  

Using AWS Backup, you can centralize and automate data protection across AWS Services. 

In this Solution , AWS Backup creates a backup of the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes for each Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance. 

For this Amazon EBS volumes , this Solution uses a new Backup vault , which is a container that stores and organizes your backups. 

A backup plan, part of the backup vault . Defines when and how you want to backup your AWS resources. you can create multiple backup plans for different backup requirements. 

Assign a resource to a backup plan and that resource is backed up automatically according to the Backup . You can assign resources using tags and resource IDs. 

Each backup vault must have an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key , which encrypts the backup placed in a backup vault. 

To backup an Amazon Aurora database this solution uses  the default backup vault that is created automantically for the AWS Account.
